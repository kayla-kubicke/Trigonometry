###### :small_red_triangle: Trigonometry :small_red_triangle:


The project's goal is to provide an easy-to-use package robust enough to validate and build triangle objects. Currently, a default constructor that generates an equilateral triangle and a constructor that accepts three side lengths are available on the main branch. It should be noted the three side lengths (SSS) constructor can build an equilateral triangle identical to the one built by the default constructor but remains untested for other triangles.
